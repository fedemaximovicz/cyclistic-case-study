# Cyclistic bike-share
The aim of this project is to gain insight on how casual members and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, by analyzing ride data of the past 12 months. The director of marketing believes the company's future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships, so these insights will be used to design a new marketing strategy to increase the number of annual members.

## Ask
**Three questions will guide the future marketing program:**
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
